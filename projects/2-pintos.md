Starting from a barebones skeleton, built a fully functional CLI **operating system** in a group of four, in conjunction with the Operating Systems module at university.

- Implemented **multithreaded** behaviour, with both priority donation and MLFQS capabilities.
- Supported user programs by implementing thread-safe interface of functions to the user.
- Used the second-chance algorithm to support paging for memory management.
