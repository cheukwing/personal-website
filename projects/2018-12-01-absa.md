In investment banking, financial analysts must manually read through many articles in order to give informed advice on investment opportunities.
Working in a group of 6 in contact with the Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) team, created a system to extract and store the sentiment of subjects of interest from financial articles, increasing the productivity of analysts by giving them quick and easy access to a rich database of information.

- Developed a rule-based **NLP** solution for the extraction and storage of entity-attribute pairs with their calculated sentiment using **Python**.
- Showcased the solution by building a demo application with a **RESTful Python** backend and **React** frontend, and presented this as part of a group presentation.
