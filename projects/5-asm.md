In a group of four wrote an emulator, taking binary instructions and changing the simulated registers and memory accordingly, and an assembler, taking assembly instructions and translating them into binary, for the ARM11 architecture.

- Used an explicit fetch-execute cycle to fully represent the status of the program counter at each point.
- Implemented a linked-list to ensure the binary instructions were written in the correct order.
