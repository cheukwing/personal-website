Unbalanced diets are a major problem in the UK and learning about proper nutrition can be a daunting task for someone wanting to make a change.
In a group of four, created a meal planning web application with a focus accurate nutritional statistics and meal plan sharing between knowledgeable and less knowledgeable people.
Those less knowledgeable can thus easily find meal plans which match government recommended guidelines or their own custom goals, helping them on their journey to a healthier lifestyle.

- Developed a full stack **React/Node/PostgreSQL** web application, using weekly **Agile** development iterations to ensure core features were added in a timely fashion.
- Implemented **human-centered-design** techniques including user stories, and micro-iterations for UX design from demoing and surveying potential users.
