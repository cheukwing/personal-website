Created a **compiler** for WACC, a simple language with C/ALGOL 68-like syntax, in a group of four.
WACC programs were input, translating the source code into ARM11 assembly instructions.

- Specified a context-free grammar for use with **ANTLR** to build a parse tree.
- Made thorough use of functional programming capabilities provided by **Kotlin** to build and verify an abstract syntax tree.
- Implemented type inference as an extension.
