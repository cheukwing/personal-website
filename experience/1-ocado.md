- Connected together several pieces of sensor hardware with several **computer vision** libraries to develop a single **C++** library with which to track the real time movements of a person.
- Developed the library into a **Javascript Electron** application _robot-video-conf_, using **WebRTC** to transmit and map the movements to a remote, life-size, robotic upper body.
