Hello, I'm Michael and welcome to my [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) website!
My middle (Chinese) name is Cheuk Wing, which is unsurprising rarer than Michael, so that's how I brand myself online - it certainly makes domains cheaper!

I have some small, throwaway projects you can checkout too:

- Pong, made using Elm: <https://pong.cheukwing.dev>
- Stand sheets, inspired by the series Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: <https://jojo.cheukwing.dev>

Outside of programming, I'm a big fan of cooking and at home you'll often find me either binging food videos on YouTube or preparing a massive cauldron of food to last me the week.
